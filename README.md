# King County House Price Dataset

I completed this EDA as part of the 6-month part-time Data Practitioner bootcamp at [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/en) during 5 days (2.5 full work days). It is my first EDA project. 

The assignment was to explore a dataset of home sales using data analysis techniques to derive recommendations for a fictional client. 
More information on the assignment can be found in [assignment.md](https://github.com/vlampe/EDA-house-prices/blob/main/assignment.md). 

[EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/vlampe/EDA-house-prices/blob/main/EDA.ipynb) is a Jupyter Notebook that describes the steps taken during this EDA, the hypotheses and conclusions. [column_names.md](https://github.com/vlampe/EDA-house-prices/blob/main/column_names.md) includes descriptions of the data set columns. 

[EDA-results.pdf](https://github.com/vlampe/EDA-house-prices/blob/main/EDA-results.pdf) includes a slide-show with the final results and insights for the client.
